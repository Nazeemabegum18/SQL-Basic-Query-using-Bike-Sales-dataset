## Product & Customer Orders SQL Database

This project demonstrates creating and managing a SQL database named Product to track customer orders and product details.

## Steps and Implementation:
  ### 1. Database and Table Creation:
  - Created the Product database and the customer table with fields for product category, subcategory, name, price, region, colour, customer details, order date, and payment method.
  - Added Product_Subcategoty as an additional column.

  ### 2. Data Insertion:

  - Inserted multiple records representing different product categories (Mountain, Road, Touring Bikes) across various regions and customers.

  ### 3. Basic Queries:

  - Filtered products by price, region, payment method, and customer name patterns.
  - Retrieved specific customer or product details based on conditions.

  ### 4. Aggregations & Summaries:

  - Counted total orders, total revenue, average, minimum, and maximum product prices.
  - Calculated revenue per customer and total sales per product category.

  ### 5. Filtering and Sorting:
   - Filtered products within specific price ranges or by region.
   - Sorted products by price and customers alphabetically.

  ### 6. Advanced SQL Features:
  - Used DISTINCT to find unique product categories and regions.
  - Applied date functions to filter orders by month/year.
  - Used string functions to analyse customer names.

This project provides a hands-on approach to SQL database design, data insertion, querying, aggregation, and filtering, making it useful for learning and practising real-world data analysis with SQL.

Employed HAVING to filter groups and LIMIT to display top products.
